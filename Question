Student Information System Application You are requested to write a C++ program to calculate the total marks (100%) scored by each student of a cohort (say 5 students) for the following modules AI, Mobile Communication Engineering and IP Telephony and then compute the average marks of the cohort. The program will prompt the user to enter the number of students and marks for each assessment components. To compute the total marks (on 100%), 2 assessment components are considered:   coursework (50%) and exam (50%).  There is one class test (50 marks for weightage of 20%) and one mini-project (70 marks for a weightage of 30%) for coursework. Exams are assessed on 100 marks. To achieve the above,

a).	create a class named Marks with data members for student ID, name and componentsâ€™ marks. 
b)	create three other classes inheriting the Marks class, namely AI, Mobile Communication Engineering and IP Telephony, which are used to define marks in individual modules of each student. The student ID of each student will be generated automatically.
c)	Use any other innovative features and C++ codes to achieve the above (examples, multiple/multilevel   inheritance   and   polymorphism, late   binding, virtual   base   class, templates, etc.).
